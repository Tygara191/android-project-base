# Android Project Base
## What is this?
This is a basis for an android My vision for how Android apps should be architectured.
It is based on my personal experience and ideas as an Android developer. It draws heavy inspiration from some of [Alex Milanov](https://github.com/alex-milanov)'s ideas and ways.

## What are the goals?
- Unidirectional data flow
- Stateless code
- Predictability of the code
- Scalability
- Testability

## TBD:
- The project still lacks tests. The idea is to steer the architecture in a TDD-friendly direction.
- Dependency injection.
- Introduce Jetpack ViewModel
